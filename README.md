# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1) variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were ground_clearance (pvalue = 5.77e-08) and vehicle_length (pvalue= 2.60e-12).
2) The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the coefficient of the variables are not equal to 0
3) This linear model somewhate predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. R^2 = 0.7149 which means this model is about 71.49% accurate.
